# AlertX Project Structure

This project follows a specific structure to organize its files and directories. Here is an overview of the RACINE project structure:

```
Racine-Project/
â”œâ”€â”€ binary/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [binary_file]       # Binary file of the machine learning model
â”œâ”€â”€ dataset/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [datasets]          # Datasets used for the model training
â”œâ”€â”€ Documents/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [documents]         # Important project documents (reports, useful books, etc.)
â”œâ”€â”€ interface/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [interface_code]    # Code for the project interface
â”œâ”€â”€ Notebook/

â””â”€â”€ src/
    â”œâ”€â”€ classifier.py       # Module for classification of flows based on service types
    â”œâ”€â”€ file_write3.py      # Module for writing log files

## Description of Directories and Files

- `binary/`: This directory contains the binary file of the machine learning model used in the project.

- `dataset/`: It stores the datasets that are used for training the machine learning model.

- `Documents/`: This directory contains important project documents such as reports, useful books, and other reference materials.

- `interface/`: It contains the code for the project interface, which is responsible for the user interaction and visualization.

- `Notebook/`: This directory includes notebooks used during the machine learning algorithm training phase. These notebooks may contain code, explanations, and analysis related to the project.

- `src/`: The `src` directory contains the source code files for the project. Here is a brief description of the files:

  - `classifier.py`: This module handles the classification of flows based on service types.

  - `file_write3.py`: It is responsible for writing log files.

  - `Flow.py`: This file defines a class for packet flow retrieval.

  - `GraphUtils.py`: This file defines a class for handling data structures.

  - `wifi_AP_ST_Topo.py`: It represents the physical network topology of the WiFi access points and stations.

  - `wifi_classifier.py`: This module is responsible for dataset generation and external classification.

  - `wifi_monitor_v8.py`: This file contains the Ryu controller implementation with new rules and functionalities.

<p style="color: red">Before observe each RACINE's features with ryu controller you have to launch mininet's topology in 
`wifi_AP_ST_Topo.py` otherwise you will observe anythings in your ryu app </p><br />

```shell 
python3 wifi_AP_ST_Topo.py
```
